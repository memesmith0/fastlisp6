# fastlisp6
this is essentially a version of fastlisp where the left parentheses is the ibis combinator or the apply function

i don't know if this is a good idea and honestly at this point i do not really care. if this version of fastlisp isn't good then you've gotta dig up a version of fastlisp 4.2 (which I don't seem to be able to find).
